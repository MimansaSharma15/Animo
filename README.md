## Description
Mental Health related issues are probably the next pandemic that will hit our country and we are not ready for it. Even in 2020 the stigma around mental health related issues is so big in India that almost 50% of it goes unnoticed.
Mental Health : is a loaded term. It can trigger a dizzying array of reactions when we hear it.
Animo is the latin translation of mind and noticing the sync where mental health is the well being of one's mind, our main objective is to educate the population still oblivious to the issues regarding mental health.And provide a safe space for those who want to learn about what it is and wether they need help. We want to provide a platform to every individual who wishes to learn more about their mental health and the path to mindfulness.

## How To Use
## Chatbot Animo
The web app allows you to interact with the bot and ask as many questions as you like regarding mental health starting from what it means to identifying symptoms of any possible underlying issues. You can have a proper conversation with our bot asking as many questions as you'd like without any fear of judgement.

## Help Bot
We also allow the users to look for the best solution for their problem. We use our bot to analyse the users current mental state and if based on the analysis we encounter patterns of troubled behaviour we provide them with a service which allows them to know about the nearest Psychiatrists or counsellors available all they needs to do is to enter their pincode in the popup . Which in turn provides them with multiple links to nearest establishments by checking their loactions.

## Internal Working
ANIMO CHATBOT: 
A club of AI models working together is what makes up Animo. They work to power the chatbot and it includes an encoder model
and a decoder model. Which essentially creates a sequence to sequence model which uses Gated Recurrent Units 1o give a suitable reply to the entered question by the user.

Recommendations:
This is another AI model running along side the chatbot models which analyzes the user input to recommend the best options to the user , If the model feels that the user is in a troubled state of mind and might harm themselves it asks the user for their pin code and then returns a list of links which could help them ranging from nearest mental health experts to the nearest hospitals. The pincode allows the bot to connect their location.
